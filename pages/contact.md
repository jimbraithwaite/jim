This year - 2020 - became my 35th on this earth.

Of the 35 years I've now been alive, I’ve now been living with a chronic, terminal cancer for more years than I’ve not.

On the x I found out I had a Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia.

**I was 17.**

As those who know me can attest; my memory isn't the sharpest. I remember that day clearly.

My dad had driven to collect me from my girlfriend's house, and I was feeling particularly weak.

The truth is I had been feeling weak for months. My legs and hips had in recent weeks turned almost entirely purple with bruising that looked like I'd fallen from a mountain.

When the weakness started I attributed it to a teenage phase. Getting up early for college, not going to bed early enough, probably not eating all that well. *Burning the candle at both ends.*

When the bruising appeared one day, I was on the loo. I looked down and saw my hip and thigh had some nasty bruising. I was very confused - I couldn't recall taking a tumble. I put it down to a possible knock on a night out after college.

It was when the bruising appeared on the *other* side of my body I was concerned. How could I have fallen, or been knocked *on both sides*? My mind started to move towards thinking something wasn't right. Eventually I plucked up the courage to do what you're never supposed to do - Google your symptoms.

The (Google) results that came back weren't great. Some of it pointed to the possibility of leukaemia and other blood cancers. I worried some more. *Surely I can't have this?* *No. The likelyhood is miniscule. There has to be some other explanation.* A few weeks passed, as I waited for the bruises to subside. They didn't. If anything they were getting worse. The strangest part of the bruising was that they didn't hurt. Bruising on this scale *had* to hurt. I showed my parents my findings, but they were the same. That's not likely; it will be something trivial. Try not to worry. In those few weeks I was in limbo. In denial.

I'd been waking up every morning feeling like I needed to go back to bed. Knocked for six. This particular morning I'd had enough. When my dad arrived I was miserable, so I mustered the courage to head to the local hospital to see a doctor on our way home. We waited a while, then was seen. I described my symptoms, showed him my bruising. He immediately recommended doing blood tests. They took the bloods and we were told to come back in an hour or so once they'd been processed. Rather than sitting in the waiting room we drove out to the seafront, sat in the car and watched the sea. I had a can of coke from a cafe. We sat, mostly in silence, interspersed with moments of feeble optimism.

When we arrived back at the hospital, we were quickly ushered into a room. There was an air of concern.

It wasn't good.

The consultant started by explaining blood counts. I knew about the different blood cells, but not what levels they were supposed to be. They gave me a brief run down. Yep, yep, white cells, red cells, platelets.

White cell totals, in the normal range, are supposed to be (roughly) between 5 - 10 (x10^3 parts per micro litre).

Mine were over 200. Logically, I asked why. He was reluctant to give me definitive answer, but said a possible cause could be some blood cancer mutations (such as leukaemia) cause the bone marrow (responsible for creating your blood cells) to flood your system with far too many immature white cells. They couldn't confirm this until more tests were done. My world, in that moment, collapsed. 

The ensuing days were a desperate grey fog.

I was bundled in an ambulance and transferred from Scarborough Hospital to Leeds General Infirmary, where I would stay for four days. I don't remember those days nearly as well. It's almost as though my viewpoint changed in that moment, and suddenly I was was a spectator in someone else's life, at least for a time.

I lost count of the number of tests. I quickly got used to needles, at least in the arm. One needle however - used in taking a sample of your bone marrow from inside the bone at the back of your hip - is not something I think you ever get used to. Bone marrow aspiration is an experience you never forget.

### **Diagnosis**

Eventually the diagnosis came. I had Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia. I was in the chronic phase. I was sent home with a sack of large, brightly coloured pills.

I was in and out of hospital every two weeks, for blood and bone marrow monitoring. 

I was hooked up leukapheresis machine, a machine that pumps blood from one arm, spins it through a series of centrifuges and filters to remove the immature white cells, then the normalised blood is then pumped back into you.

After the initial shock, came the thoughts of prognosis.

Are there any treatments? If so, what are they? What is the death rate? How long do people live with this?

Again, the news wasn't good. The median time, from diagnosis to death, for Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia was 4 years.

Back in 2006, the options were very limited.

Bone marrow transplants.

The first successful transplant was performed in New York in the late 1950s. The transplant involved identical twins, one of whom had leukaemia.

There are essentially two types of bone marrow transplant. The first, from a related (sibling) donor. The second, from an unrelated donor that is selected from a bone marrow register.

A bone marrow transplant is a marathon, not a sprint. You start off with a mixture of intensive radiation 

### **The dawn of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors.**

Before Gleevec hit the market, CML patients had three options:
a. *treatment with toxic chemotherapy,*
b. *a bone marrow transplant (which included a), or*
c. *just dying.
Even with treatment, patients rarely lived longer than three years.*

**I was 17.**

Aside from the physical and mental trauma one would expect, one of ways in which cancer affected me that I'm most sad about, is that it took from me the optimism of my youth. 

At 17, you are at your zenith. The centre-point of the venn-diagram between the self-awareness and confidence you gain reaching your late teens - a mind more open to life's possibilities than the innocence of childhood, and the long stretch of time out in front of you, the life ahead of you, before the rigours of adult life have taken their toll.

At 17, you’re going to live forever. Not a median of 4 more years.

At 17, it's challenging to process feeling lucky if you reach 21.

At 17, you are far enough along your mortal coil to have just start thinking, doing and dreaming about the life ahead of you, without little awareness - let alone anxiety - of ones own mortality. That rears its head later in one's life. I was fast-tracked from the mind of a 17 year old, to 70, without the space (of life) between to reflect, without the wisdom to deal with such thought, and without the comfort of a 'life-lived'.

Cancer, so far, has been relatively kind to me - physically, at least. Mentally it has taken its toll.

**Why I wrote this**

I think it’s important to document, for sake of recall, important moments in ones life.
